# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue (e.g., a malicious link in this list), please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/sinzin91/awesome-sre-skills/security/advisories/new).

For urgent issues, you can also open a regular issue with the `[SECURITY]` prefix in the title.

## Scope

This is a curated list of links to observability resources, not executable software. Security concerns for this project include:

- **Malicious links** — URLs that lead to malware, phishing, or other harmful content
- **Hijacked domains** — Previously legitimate resources whose domains have been taken over
- **Compromised resources** — Tools or documentation sites that have been compromised
- **Harmful content** — Resources that now contain inappropriate or dangerous material

## What This Policy Does NOT Cover

Since this is an awesome-list and not software:

- We do not handle vulnerabilities in the linked tools themselves (report those to the respective projects)
- We do not provide security guarantees for external resources
- We cannot control the security practices of linked projects

## Response

When a security issue is reported:

1. We will investigate the reported link within 48 hours
2. Confirmed malicious links will be removed immediately
3. We may add warnings for resources with known security concerns
4. The reporter will be credited (unless they prefer anonymity)

Thank you for helping keep this list safe for the community!
